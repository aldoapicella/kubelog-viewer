# Kubernetes Log Viewer Environment Configuration
# For development purposes - set these to your actual Kubernetes cluster values

# Kubernetes API endpoint (set to a real K8s API server URL)
# VITE_K8S_API=https://your-k8s-api-server:443

# Service account token for authentication
# VITE_K8S_TOKEN=your-service-account-token

# Optional: Custom CA certificate path for TLS
# VITE_K8S_CA=/path/to/ca.crt

# Development mode - these are commented out since we don't have a real K8s cluster
# The Vite config will use http://localhost:8080 as fallback
